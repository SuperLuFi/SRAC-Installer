                           How to Install Libarry (JENDL-3.3)
*******************************************************************************
(1) Required Disk Capacity for Installation
    Size of this library file will increase at twice or more after the
    installation of binary library data.

(2) Before Installation
    The SRAC code must be installed before installation of this library,
    because a ulility program in the SRAC code will be used.
    The Installer(@PunchMe) will ask you where the SRAC code is, then you
    should reply full path name of the SRAC code.
    (A new file:tool/sracdir.txt will be made at that time.)
    You can put this file on any directory and you can change the file name
    (e.g. /home/okumura/SRACLIB/JENDL33 ) before installation.

(3) Installation of Library
    Installation can be done in the menu of @PunchMe.
    The @PunchMe executes an installation command tool/LibInst.sh
    as a background job.
    The required time for the library installation is about 15 min.- 1 hour.
    The messages will be written in the directory tmp/. Check them 
    carefully and delete them.
    The binary library data used in SRAC will be generated in directories:
    pds/pfast, pds/pmcrs, pds/pthml. They are the data for the fast energy,
    resonace energy for ultra-fine group calculation, and thermal energy
    calculation, respectively.

    *Note (manual-installation) :
    In some computers, the installation should be done as a remote batch job.
    ( for example, public machines where computation time is limitted. )
    In such the case, please change the contents of LibInst.sh and execute
    it by yourself not by @PunchMe.

(4) Uninstallation of Library
    All installed data can be easily deleted in the menu of @PunchMe.
    Unistallation comand is tool/LibRset.sh. This command restore the 
    library file to the initial condition.
    When you failed the library installation, execute this command, and 
    try installation again after you remove causes of troubles.

(5) Permitting of Library to Other Users (if necessary)                        
    Execute the command tool/Permit.sh. The Permit.sh changes the library      
    access mode (all users/group users/owner only).                            
                                                                               
(6) How to Make the Concatinated Library                                       
    Some library has data for many nuclides, while some library do not so many.
    If there is no data for the nuclide you want to use, look for it in other  
    librarys. As all library data is stored by nuclide,                        
    it is easy to supplement or replace specified nuclides data.               

    <Example : Replacement of Pu-239 data in ENDF/B-IV by JENDL-3.3 data>

            cp SRACLIB-JDL33/pfast/?PU9*   SRACLIB-EDFB4/pfast
            cp SRACLIB-JDL33/pmcrs/?PU9*   SRACLIB-EDFB4/pmcrs
            cp SRACLIB-JDL33/pthml/?PU9*   SRACLIB-EDFB4/pthml

    This is convenient to investigate the effects of different library data.

    <Example : Supplement of ENDF/B-IV library with JENDL-3.3>

            cp SRACLIB-EDFB4/pfast/*       SRACLIB-JDL33/pfast
            cp SRACLIB-EDFB4/pmcrs/*       SRACLIB-JDL33/pmcrs
            cp SRACLIB-EDFB4/pthml/*       SRACLIB-JDL33/pthml

    Here, all nuclide data existing in the ENDF/B-IV library will be
    over-written on the JENDL-3.3 library.
    However this procedure using "*" often failed when there are so many 
    files, because of shortage of working memory. In such case, copy files
    in installments.(A sample shell-script is there in tool/Concat.sh)

            cp  SRACLIB-JDL33/pthml/[A-D]*   NewLib/pthml
            cp  SRACLIB-JDL33/pthml/[E-J]*   NewLib/pthml
            cp  SRACLIB-JDL33/pthml/[K-N]*   NewLib/pthml
            cp  SRACLIB-JDL33/pthml/[O-Z]*   NewLib/pthml
   
    It should be noted the over-written library can not be restored.
    You shold backup the original library before concatination.
