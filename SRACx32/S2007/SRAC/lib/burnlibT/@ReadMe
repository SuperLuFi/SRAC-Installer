For Thermal Reactors ===========================================================

1) u4cm6fp50bp16T
     - Heavy nuclides   : 21 nuclides from U-234 to Cm-246
     - Fission products : 49 explicit FPs and 1 pseudo one
     - Burnable poisons : 16 isotopes of B, Cd, In, Er, Hf
                          (Ag and Gd are included in FP chain)
     Standard chain model for nuclear analyses of U-235 or Pu fueled 
     thermal reactors. Some nuclides for PIE and burnup indicators are
     included. This chain model is validated by comparison with results of no
     pseudo burnup calculation upto 70GWd/t and cooling after burnup 
     from one year to 1000 years.

2) th2cm6fp50bp16T
     - Heavy nuclides   : 28 nuclides from Th-232 to Cm-246
     - Fission products : 49 explicit FPs and 1 pseudo one
     - Burnable poisons : 16 isotopes of B, Cd, In, Er, Hf
                             (Ag and Gd are included in FP chain)
     Standard chain model for nuclear analyses of U-233/Th fueled thermal
     reactors. The chain model for FP and BP nuclides is the same to that of
     u4cm6fp50bp16T.

3) u4cm6fp104bp12T
     - Heavy nuclides   : 21 nuclides from U-234 to Cm-246
     - Fission products : 103 explicit FPs and 1 pseudo one
     - Burnable poisons : 12 isotopes of B, Er, Hf
                          (Ag, In, Cd and Gd are included in FP chain)
     Detailed chain model for all-purpose: e.g. PIE analyses, estimations of
     Activity ratio for burnup indicators, decay heat and radioactivity
     (after 1-year cooling), and so on.

4) admin/th2cm6fp193bp6T
     - Heavy nuclides   : 28 nuclides from Th-232 to Cm-246
     - Fission products : 193 explicit FPs (No pseudo FP)
     - Burnable Poisons : 6 isotopes of B-10 and Hf(5 isotopes)
     Most detailed chain model for thermal reactors.
     This chain model is for developpers to make cross section of pseudo 
     fission product for other chain models.


For Fast Reactors =============================================================

1) u4cm6fp50bp16F
     Production paths of burnable nuclides are the same to thoes of the 
     chain model u4cm6fp50bp16F, however, all data is based on fast fission
     for a) energy per fission, b) Isomeric ratio, c) Fission yield.

2) admin/th2cm6fp193bp6F
     Production paths of burnable nuclides are the same to thoes of the
     chain model th2cm6fp193bp6F, however, all data is based on fast fission
     for a) energy per fission, b) Isomeric ratio, c) Fission yield.
