C   PARAMETERS TO DETERMINE SIZE OF VIRTUAL PDS FILE ON MEMORY
C   MXVRF : MAX. SIZE (WORDS) OF AVAILABLE MEMORY FOR VPDS
C   MXMBR : MAX. NUMBER OF MEMBERS(INCLUDING GHOST) IN VPDS
C   MXPDS : MAX. NUMBER OF PDS ATTRIBUTIONS (EX. FLUX,XS,....)
C
cksk  PARAMETER ( MXVRF = 10000000 )
cksk  PARAMETER ( MXMBR = 200 )
cksk  PARAMETER ( MXPDS = 10 )
C 
C---- You do not need large parameter values for the programs where
C     virtual PDS file access is not done (MOACS='FILE')
C     Set the following (dummy) values to save memory.
C
      PARAMETER ( MXVRF = 10  )
      PARAMETER ( MXMBR = 10  )
      PARAMETER ( MXPDS = 10  )
C
C   VIRTUAL PDS ACCESS MAY BE FAIL DUE TO LACK OF MEMORY(MXVRF) OR FULL
C   OF MEMBER LIST(MXMBR). THEN FILE I/O (DIRECT PDS ACCESS) WILL BE
C   USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY.
C   THE AUTO-CLEAR HAS A FUNCTION TO DUMP ALL MEMBERS IN VPDS TO PDS AND
C   CLEAR MEMORY. AFTER THAT V-PDS ACCESS WILL BE RECOVERED.
C   THE AUTO-CLEAR WILL BE PUT INTO MOTION WHEN THE FOLLOWING 
C   CONDITIONS ARE ALL SATISFIED.
C   1) ICAUTO = 1
C   2) THE NUMBER OF THE VPDS ACCESS FAILURES REACHED TO MXFAIL
C   3) LEFT AVAILABLE MEMORY FOR NEW MEMBERS IS LESS THAN LEFTAV(%)
C      OR MEMBER LIST IS FULL
C   THE AUTO-CLEAR CAN BE SUPPRESSED BY ICAUTO=0 DEFINED IN AN INCLUDE
C   FILE. ICAUTO, MXFAIL, LEFTAV ARE DEFINED IN THE INCLUDE FILE.
C   WHEN ICAUTO=0 AND THE TWO CONDITIONS 2) & 3) ARE SATISFIED, ACCESS
C   MODE FOR ALL VPDS WILL BE SWITCHED TO PDS TO AVOID WASTEFUL VPDS
C   SEARCH OPERATION. IF FUNC=CLAR WILL BE CALLED AFTER THAT, ACCESS 
C   MODE WILL BE RECOVERED.
C
      PARAMETER ( ICAUTO =  1 )
      PARAMETER ( MXFAIL =  5 )
      PARAMETER ( LEFTAV = 10 )
