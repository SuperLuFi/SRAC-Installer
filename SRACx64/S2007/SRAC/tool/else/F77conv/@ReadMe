#   <<< about the ksk77 script >>>
#
# The ksk77 script invokes the f2c (free Fortran-to-C translator in GNU)
# and gcc (free C compiler in GNU) successively. Therefore, it can be used
# as real Fortran compiler (e.g. ksk77 -o sample.out *.f).
#
# The ksk77 script is my hand-made commnad written by c-shell.
# It may not be so excelent and its functions may be limitted as compared
# with real compilers, however, it will work successfully at least for the
# installation of this code (I hope).
# You can use ksk77 (My first name is KeiSuKe) freely at your own risk.
