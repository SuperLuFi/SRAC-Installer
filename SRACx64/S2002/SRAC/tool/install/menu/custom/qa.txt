              Q & A for Installation of the SRAC load module
*******************************************************************************
Q1 :Installation of the SRAC load module failed. What shall I do ?
A1 :Try installation of load module again after you change Fortran compiler
    or compile options. You can change them by the custom-installation
    menu(2).
    If that also failed, copy the shellscripts SRAC/tool/lmmake/lmmk/lmmk.sh,
    and edit it as you like. 

Q2 :I want a Makefile for SRAC.
A2 :It's not easy to write the Makefile applicable to any cases and any 
    computers. You can generate a set of full source programs by the 
    custom-installation menu(4) or by changing the shellscript in SRAC/
    tool/lmmake/lmmk.sh. Please make a Makefile by yourself.
    In the next version of installer, that will be supported.

Q3: I can not find the directory SRAC/tool/lmmake/. Why?
A3: It is generated by pre-processor and deleted by uninstaller for 
    pre-processed data.
    Execute the pre-processor. 

Q4: I want to keep object files. 
A4: Use the shellscripts in the directory SRAC/tool/lmmake/objmk/.
    Full scalar objects will be kept in SRAC/obj/SCall.
    In the case of vector computers, vector objects also will be kept in 
    SRAC/obj/VPpart. Overwrite the objects in VPpart on the objects in 
    SCall, because same named objects will be there in the SCall and VPpart.

Q5: I want to make a load module with more large memory size, or I want to
    change the dimmension size.
A5: Edit the shellscript SRAC/tool/lmmake/lmmk.sh, and change an include
    file name. You can find include files for typical memory size in the 
    directory SRAC/src/inc/.
    If you have object files, you can use the shellscripts in
    SRAC/lmmake/lmupdt/.

Q6: The custom-installer load did not work well. Why?
A6: This option do not supprot the vector computers and also PC with Linux 
    ( except the case you chose the menu "You dont know who I am" ).
