              Q & A for Installation of the SRAC load module
*******************************************************************************
Q1 :Installation of the SRAC load module failed. What shall I do ?
A1 :Try installation of load module again after you change Fortran compiler
    or compile options. You can change them by the custom-installation
    menu(2).
    If that also failed, copy the shellscripts SRAC/tool/lmmake/lmmk/lmmk.sh,
    and edit it as you like. 

Q2: I can not find the directory SRAC/tool/lmmake/. Why?
A2: It is generated by pre-processor and deleted by uninstaller for 
    pre-processed data.
    Execute the pre-processor. 

Q3: I want to keep object files. 
A3: Use the shellscripts in the directory SRAC/tool/lmmake/objmk/.
    Full scalar objects will be kept in SRAC/obj/SCall.
    In the case of vector computers, vector objects also will be kept in 
    SRAC/obj/VPpart. Overwrite the objects in VPpart on the objects in 
    SCall, because same named objects will be there in the SCall and VPpart.

Q4: I want to make a load module with more large memory size, or I want to
    change the dimmension size.
A4: Edit the shellscript SRAC/tool/lmmake/lmmk.sh, and change an include
    file name. You can find include files for typical memory size in the 
    directory SRAC/src/inc/.
    If you have object files, you can use the shellscripts in
    SRAC/lmmake/lmupdt/.

Q5: The custom-installer did not work well. Why?
A5: This option do not supprot vector computers and also PC with Linux 
    ( except the case you chose the menu "You dont know who I am" ).
