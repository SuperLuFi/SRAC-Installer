###################### About options for Makefile #################
#
#  As the pre-processor could not recognize your system identity.
#  compile driver name and options are assumed like followings;
#
#             F77    = f77
#             FFLAGS =
#
#  Change them if they are not appropriate for your system.
#
#  The functions of the following subroutines are suppressed.
#     uclock.f  : get used CPU time
#     udate.f   : get current date
#     utime.f   : get current time
#
#  "udate.f" and "utime.f" are not essential for calculation, however,
#  "uclock.f", which will always returen zero value, should be replaced
#  if possible.
#  Otherwise, calculation can not be stopped by limit of CPU time,
#  and restart files can not be generated if job is killed.
#
#  Other assumptions
#     ugetenv.f  : GETENV function is available (most of UNIX allows).
#     usystm.f   : Enviroments for file initialization are similar
#                  to Sun, IBM, Linux, ...
#                  (e.g. device no. of standard error file = 0).
#                  It should shoud be changed in HP series.
#                  Memory addressing is programed assuming 32bit machines.
#                  (maybe work well, but consume so much memory).
#                  It should be changed in 64 bit machines.
