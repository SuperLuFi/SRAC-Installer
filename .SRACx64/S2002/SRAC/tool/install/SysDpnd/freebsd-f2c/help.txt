<<< about the f77 script >>>

    In the recent FreeBSD, the f77 script is equipped.
  The f77 script invokes the f2c (free Fortran-to-C translator in GNU) 
  and gcc (free C compiler in GNU) successively. Therefore, it can be used 
  as real Fortran compiler (e.g. f77 -o sample.out *.f).
    This installer will work assuming you have the Fortran compiler whose
  driver is "f77".

    For the persons who don't have the f77 script now, I prepared the 
  alternative f77 script written by c-shell. This may not be so excelent
  as compared with the original one, however, it will work successfully 
  at least for the installation of this code (I hope).
    You can use my hand-made f77 script (ksk77) freely at your own risk.
  If you want to see the contents of my hand-made one, type the file :
  SRAC/cmnd/ksk77.


<<< about the menu : What shall we do ? >>>

    This menu will appear only when the f77 compiler was not available.

(1) about menu #1 (Help)
    Show this help information

(2) about menu #2 (install my hand-made f77)
    As mentioned first, my hand-made f77 script is equipped in this system.
  You can install the SRAC with it. The original file is 
  SRAC/cmnd/ksk77. (My first name is KeiSuKe)
  If you select #2, the ksk77 command will be copyed in the directry you hope
  as the file "f77". 
    The installer will ask you the directory where the f77 command will be
  made. Then, You should enter the directory name (by full path name)
  in which your other private commands are stored. (e.g. $HOME/bin).
    After that, you must quit @PunchMe to reset command-search-path so that
  the f77 can be executed in any directory. And execute @PunchMe and 
  pre-processor again. Then, the pre-processor will be successfully executed 
  instead of this menu.
                     ************************************************
                       Try anyway !  This installer will guide you.
                     ************************************************

(3) about menu #q (bye-bye)
    Functions of my hand-made f77 script are ristricted. If you don't 
  like my f77 script, you should get the original one by yourself.
  If you select #q, you will return to the previous main menu. Then, quit
  @PunchMe and come again after you get a better f77.
